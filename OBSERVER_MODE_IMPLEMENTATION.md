### 🔧 Technical Implementation

#### Type Updates

}

interface DebateMessage {
  side: 'FOR' | 'AGAINST' | 'OBSERVER';
}
```

#### Key Functions Modified
- `selectSide()` - Now accepts 'OBSERVER' option

- `sendMessage()` - Handles observer message styling
- Video functions - Handle observer camera access differently
- **Auto-selection removed** - Users now choose their own role
- **Role change functionality** - Users can change roles during debate

### 🔧 Recent Fixes Applied

**Solution**: 
- Removed auto-selection of sides when joining rooms
- Added prominent role selection UI in participants panel
- Added role change functionality for flexibility
- Multiple selection points for better UX

#### Enhanced Role Selection UX
- **Prominent Yellow Card**: Stands out in participants panel
